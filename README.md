# Linux-Mint-Server
My custom script to turn linux mint into a headless server.
Do you want to turn into linux mint into a headless serve after installation? 
Then this is the script for you.

My script will remove all graphical and desktop environments and alot of unnecessary and unwanted files. 

It also installs a few server-related packages.
