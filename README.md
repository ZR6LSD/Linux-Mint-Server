### Conclusion

Have fun with it! But keep in mind that I have not tested my scrips on every other Linux distribution available and I cannot offer support to you if they don't work on yours. I would love to hear your comments and I will happily look at any suggestions for new features or code fixes but I do not have the time or inclination to run and test your modified versions, act as a beta tester or even offer useful advice if your changes are not working. I am NOT an expert; I am simply sharing tools that I use everyday.
